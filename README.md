Folder-Relocator
================
Android app that allows the user to schedule file or folder copying or moving between different paths of the phone. Initially designed to periodicaly move Whatsapp videos and photos to an SD card.
Never tested on phones that I don't own, so it didn't work in some phones. Also, never updated, so it doesn't work in any Android version after its initial release. No longer maintained.
